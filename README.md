# dip editor
Multi-platform Text editor purely written in Rust, supercharged by Bevy game engine and Dioxus UI framework.

### Why Game Engine?
Bevy is known as a game engine but with its extensible plugin structure and remarkable ECS plugin, it could be used for not only games but anything such as this project.

### What is Dioxus?
